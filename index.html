                    </br>
                    Born in Lomé, West Africa. &nbsp Raised in Moscow, Russia. &nbsp Living in New York City, USA. &nbsp Yea, I know... Diplomat parents. &nbsp
                    My undergratuate was a Bachelor's in Business Administration with a concentration on Hospitality Managment, which lead to a 10 year career in Beverage Operations Management (alcohol, yes), and Nightlife Managment - "Boooorrrriiing!" - I want to build things. &nbsp So, creativity and visualization of concepts, along with problem-solving have always come naturally to me. &nbsp Design by principle, however, is a skill I have worked very hard to gain a high level in, along with software development and architecture. &nbsp The front-end was the apple of my eye. &nbsp Then, somewhere between 2017 - 2018, I completed 2 highly acclaimed and rigourous Software Development Intensives (and countless other certifications), as well as a Data Science intensive where I was able to put industry and professional best-practices to the test on various projects. &nbsp Over the last four years, I have freelanced, interned, and worked at various companies, start-ups, and on one-off projects. &nbsp I currently work as a Data Engineer at Cognizant. &nbsp I speak fluent Javascript, Ruby, Python, PHP, and Java. &nbsp I also can pick up whatever language you may require in a relatively short time.
                    
                    &nbsp In my spare time :D, I run a design studio and a digital agency of my own, where I am the principal "everything". &nbsp I've done work for past clients in the likes of Huge, Inc, Grey Goose, Moēt & Hennessy, and Puma. &nbsp Thanks for listening, checkout some projects below, and please do get in touch.
